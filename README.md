# The Casters Companion

## Description

I recently joined a new DND group and decided on making a Wizard character. Since casting spells is a complex thing I decided to create an app to assist in this. After looking at a couple of the apps on the Android store I was disatisfied. The styling was not the best and they just felt overall bad. The functionality was there for sure, but if I am going to be using an app a lot I want to like the way it looks. This app helps DND characters who cast spells. Spells are one of the more complex things in DND and this app helps simplify it. I was looking for a good project to learn the MERN stack with and this seemed like a complex enough app that I thought it would be a great teacher.

This is repo contains only the front end code.

## Installation

If you would like to just use this app then you can install it as a PWA from this url: https://casterscompanion.onrender.com/. If you would like to add to this project just create a pull request and I will set it up.

## Usage

This app is meant to be used by DnD players who use casting. You can create an account to store spells from the All Spells to My Spells. As well as Equip these spells, set spell slots and rest.

## Credits

This app was build solely by me. I used documentation from React, Express, MongoDB, and Node to help me. For authentication I watched a tutorial on YouTube from The Net Ninja. I also used the D&D 5e API to pull data from. Here is a link to their page: https://www.dnd5eapi.co/.
